# php-code-cleanup

I am sharing here some useful regex that I use during my build process or during development to cleanup the code, keep conventions and remove useless lines.

The first line is the search regex and the second one replace regex. It can be used within any editor, or build tools that you use.
Feel free to add more useful regex if you have.
